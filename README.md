# Sukhoi Board

Sukhoi Board is a ortholinear mechanical keyboard that blends compact layout with fighter jet aesthetics. Inspired by the precision engineering of the Sukhoi aircraft family, this board carries the same philosophy—lightweight, powerful, and built to perform.

This board features a fully ortholinear matrix, programmable via QMK, and designed to be either soldered or hotswap depending on your preference. The case includes a subtle engraved Sukhoi logo on the top plate, making it not just a tool, but a statement piece.

## About the Board

Sukhoi Board isn’t your typical minimalist keyboard. It takes the core idea of an ortholinear layout and wraps it in a shell of aviation-grade aesthetics. The design process included weeks of testing different switch layouts, plate mount styles, and case fitments. The result is a compact but mighty board that’s flight-ready for any desk.

You can drop this board into any workflow: coding, writing, gaming, or just pretending to be in a cockpit while answering emails. The key spacing is optimized for fast finger travel and a consistent typing rhythm, even during long sessions.

## Features

Sukhoi Board packs a lot into its compact ortholinear layout. It’s fully programmable with QMK and supports VIA out of the box, making remapping and macro setup super simple. The board connects over USB-C and includes ESD protection for extra safety. If you're into knobs, there's support for a rotary encoder, and even an optional OLED screen for real-time stats, layers, or animations. The PCB is custom-designed with clean trace routing, easy-to-follow silkscreen labels, and a flexible footprint that lets you go hotswap or soldered depending on your build style. The switch support is MX-compatible, and the case itself is designed for either 3D printing or CNC machining, with mounting holes for standoffs and clean top-plate alignment. Everything was made to fit together seamlessly while keeping the build approachable.
